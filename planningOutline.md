# Planning Outline

In order to facilitate proper forethought and planning in a project, a planning outline should contain the following, at a minimum:

---

## What is the objective?

- Why?
- Who is asking for this?
- What happens if we don't do this?

## What is the current state of the system this project will affect?

- How does it work?
- What is the system flow step by step?

## What are different ways to achieve the objective?

> ### Option 1

- What changes need to me made to:
  - Front End?
  - Back End?
  - User documentation?
  - Business itself?
- What are the advantages?
  - How much code needs to be changed?
  - How quickly can this be done?
  - How many people need to be involved?
  - What are the operational changes? (database, hosting, etc)
- What are the risks?
  - Can this be reversed?
  - What kind of maintenance is involved?
  - Would a new developer or user be able to understand this?
  - Will this cause technical debt?

> ### Option 2

> ### Option 3

## What is the recommendation moving forward?

- Which option is best?
- Why?
  - Which advantages are most important?
  - Which drawbacks are acceptable?
- What are the next steps?
  - What tickets need to be created?
  - How many hours will each ticket take?
  - What is the estimated date to deployment of the project?

- References
  - Are there related images?
  - Related links, e.g Zenhub, Slack, Figma, Google docs, etc?

## Project Evolution

When dealing with large projects, it is important to identify the minimum needed to get a project started on production.

This is so we can view the work in (almost) real time. Where we can get better feedback and improve our implementation.

As the photo above implies, we want to build a complex project one usable part at a time. We don't want to wait for the whole car to be built only to find out there's something wrong with it.

Here is a helpful guide that will help you divide and slice your project into deployable pieces:

## Division

The division of the project into sections should depend on the type of the project.

Some categories to think in:

- Project Functionality
- BE/FE
- Repositories
- Components
- Permissions
- Data

## Splicing

Utilizing your knowledge of how the project is supposed to work, find the minimum from all of the divided parts of the project you need to have in order to deploy a part of the project.

This will be your first sub-project that you will submit an ETA on.

Use your knowledge of what is important about the project to determine what should be deployed first.
